[Wireframes and User Stories](./Wireframes.md).

### Initial thoughts on app structure

Create a full stack application with all CRUD features using React as Frontend framework and Spring Boot as the backend REST API. 
- Languages: JavaScript (Frontend) and Java (Backend)
- Use Spring Boot JPA for managing relational data to access and persit data between Java object/class & relational database with JPQL(Java Persistent Query Language)
- Will inclue: user Authentication
- Relational Database

### Why Spring Boot as backend technology
- Because it uses Java as main programming language to build app with minimal or zero config.
- Good to build REST APIs and can be used for small problems but its strength is: larger scale app that use a clout approach.
