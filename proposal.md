### Initial thoughts on app structure

Create a full stack application with all CRUD features using React as Frontend framework and Ruby on Rails as the backend REST API. 
- Languages: JavaScript (Frontend) and Ruby (Backend)
- Will inclue: user Authentication as a bonus functionality.
- Implement different queries to the database for easy data representation to the user such as filter by category and order by cost (ascending or descending).

### Why Ruby on Rails as a Backend Technology?
- Because it follows MVC(Model, View, Controller) and RESTful desig.
- It is quick and easy to build with minimal or zero config, thanks to all the built in generators.
- Take advantage of using Active Record as an ORM Framework and all its benefis such as perform database operations in an object-oriented approach and validate models before they get persisted to the database.
- It is used by high profile sites, including: GitHub and Airbnb.
